In this current AmIWorthIt.py version:

- the AmIWorthIt.py file allows a designer to change the questions asked AND allows a user to answer this quesion of "Am I Worth It?." 

- a user could run the applet with the command: <python AmIWorthIt.py> in the same directory as they downloaded the following files

- the applet has a "worth" section to try to convince a user's of their intrinsic worth via YN questions and responses to YN question to affirm the person's choice
	- ex. have you smiled today? yes --> "sometimes seeing you smile is all it takes to"  // no --> "you’re not alone. Sounds completely normal in fact. Sounds like you’re human. [whew we can’t have robots taking over the world with this applet]

- the applet has a "resources" section to probe some of the user's preferences to help them get some help
	- ex. Do you find that you feel more comfortable talking to a trained peer instead of a trained adult? yes --> Okay, leaning more towards adults over peers, got it // no --> Ahhh, the power of peers. Okay, understood

- the applet sets up some framework for future versions 
	- ex. providing a matrix of answers for each question by each member in answers_YN_worth and answers_YN_resources
	- ex. a resources_algorithm and potential inputs to the resources_algorithm is commented out for now but could be used to develop a more complex algorithm than the series of if statements included in this prototype

- DISCLAIMER: the logic of the code should be kosher but the code itself doesn't run quite yet ... more debugging and updated versions to come!
